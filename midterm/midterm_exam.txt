				 MIDTERM EXAM		   CS5004 Fall 2024 Silicon Valley Prof Mark	     Thursday, 24 October 2024, from 1:00 PM until 3:30 PM	     				 INSTRUCTIONS				       Please download the attached unfinished code files and import them intoIntelliJ. (It is OK to ask a TA for help if you have difficulty with thisstep.) Your job is not to finish all the code, nor is it to find every possiblebug. There are three questions that you should focus on. You may use yourlaptop with IntelliJ. You may search the WWW. Please do not talk during theexam except to ask an instructional team member to clarify a question.  Pleasedo not copy and paste code you have not written yourself, whether from awebsite or a generative AI tool. Searching the web is allowed only to help youremember the name of a Class or the syntax for calling a method. Turn in yourwork on time. Submission consists of committing your changes, pushing yourmidterm folder to GitHub, and submitting the URL to Canvas. Late submissionswill be penalized 1 point per minute as determined by Canvas. The projectinvolves implementing a simple �To Do� list. Quickly skim the files provided toget the overall idea.This exam has three parts:1. Implement the following unfinished code: (8 points each)    a. The compare method in UrgencyComparator.java    b. The compareTo method in ToDoItemAbs.java    c. sortByUrgency and sortByImportance in ToDoList    d. Only the indicated tests in ToDoItemSchoolTest.java    e. An equals method and hashCode method in ToDoItemSchool (ONLY)    f. Javadocs for ToDoItemAbs -- ONLY THE INDICATED ONES2. There are at least five known bugs in ToDoItemPersonal.java. (This does not   include missing/incomplete Javadocs or tests -- ignore those. IntelliJ   WARNINGS also do not count. Only report five bugs, even if you find more.    a. Find five bugs. (2 points each)       // On a separate line, describe each bug with an inline comment       // Bug 1: Wrong order of constructor parameter when calling super()       // Bug 2: The class is implementing the abstract class ToDoItemsAbs. However, it should be extending the abstract class.       // Bug 3: The equals() method has the wrong parameter type and doesn't handle the null/type check       // Bug 4: The description field is public, it needs to be protected just  like the parent class       // Bug 5: The toString() method is not returning a string statement    b. On a separate line,       // Summarize in English how to fix the bug (2 points each)       // Bug 1: We need to change the order to match the parent class like so: super(description, importance, urgency)       // Bug 2: We need to change 'implements ToDoItemAbs' to 'extends ToDoItemsAbs'       // Bug 3: We need to change parameter to Object and add proper  null/type checking       // Bug 4: We need to change the 'public String description' to 'protected String description'       // Bug 5: At the end of toString(), we need to add 'return str'    c. If time permits, implement your fixes (3 points each)3. Answer the five questions below by briefly by editing this file. Include it   in your GitHub folder.    a. What is the benefit of an abstract class in the ToDo example? (3 points)    // Abstract classes allow us to write code shared among different ToDo items.    // It allows for a common structure that all ToDo items must follow while also allowing    // for situation specific implementations like School.    // Abstract classes also reduces code duplication making it easier to read and implement.    b. Why isn't there a toString method in the abstract class? (3 points)    // Having an abstract class with a toStrong method would not work as we need to implement    // type specific attributes. For example, items from School need to show if they're required    // and Personal items need to show prep time.    c. Why do ToDoItemsSchool and ToDoItemsPersonal invoke "super"? (3 points)    // They do this to call upon 'super' to call the constructor of their parent class which is    // ToDoItemAbs to be able to properly initialize common fields such as description, urgency    // and importance. This is done to prevent duplication of code. If this is not done, we would    // have to repeat this logic in each child class.    d. Why are the instance variables in ToDoItemAbs protected? (3 points)    // They are kept protected in order for subclasses to be able to directly access these fields    // while still being able to maintain encapsulation from external classes.    e. Name three key ideas of OOD with brief examples. (5 points)    // From my understanding, the three key ideas are as follows:    // Idea 1: Inheritance - we can see this in ToDoItemsSchool extends ToDoItemAbs allowing it to                inherit common functionality and also being able to add its own features.    // Idea 2: Polymorphism - we can see this through how different ToDo items can be treated as               their common base type but also able to maintain specific behaviors by overriding                methods.    // Idea 3: Encapsulation - we can see this in how access to data is controlled by using                public methods and protected fields.
